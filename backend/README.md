# Backend

This is the backend for control, in a microservices architecture.

more is coming soon :D

## How to run this thing?

Run `pnpm dev`,

OR Run those commands:

1. `docker compose up -d`, this will run the whole backend, all its microservices and the backend.
2. `./docker-compose-watch.sh`, optional but makes your life waaaaayyyyyy easier :D
